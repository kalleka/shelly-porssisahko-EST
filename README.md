## Pörssisähkö: a Finnish word for electric spot price*

A free open source script for Shelly devices to control outputs by Nordpool electricity spot price. Script runs its own web server and saves its settings to Shelly's memory. Fully configured and monitored using a web browser.

Script uses API by [Elering](https://dashboard.elering.ee/api) without any other services. No need to register anywhere, it just works.

If you want to control the color of Shelly Plug Plus LED by electricity price, see [shelly-plug-nordpool-light](https://github.com/jisotalo/shelly-plug-nordpool-light).

⚠️⚠️⚠️ **NOTE - 15-MIN PRICES** ⚠️⚠️⚠️

Old versions do not support spot prices of 15-minute interval. Update the script to latest version for support.

Script calculates average price for each hour and then works as previously.

| Control minutes | Number of minutes of a hour to use. For example, if 30 minutes is always enough for heating, the output will be turned off after time has passed.                                                                                                                                                                                      | `60`                                                                 |
| Inverted        | If checked, the output is inverted. For example, if the active hour is among cheapest ones, output is set OFF.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | `no`                                                                 |
| Backup hours    | If the electricity price is unknown and Shelly knows the active time, these hours are used instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `01:00-07:00`                                                        |
| Emergency       | If Shelly doesn't know the active time, the output is set to this value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `ON`                                                                 |
| Overrides       | Can be used to set the output ON or OFF always on certain hours (no matter what is the price)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | at `05:00-07:00` and at `19:00-21:00` ON<br><br>at `01:00-02:00` OFF |

It's also possible to enter one or two custom periods with  custom hour count for each. 
This can be used to achieve a common use case "*three cheapest hours during the night 00-06 and the cheapest hour in the evening during 18-21*".

If the period is selected as `custom`, the time periods can be entered manually.

### User script features

Script calls the following functions if they are available. See above scripts for examples.

### Adjusting settings with a separate script (remotely)

This method can be used to change settings remotely outside the local network (Shelly Smart Control app etc.)


1. Install with the library or manually [`shelly-porssisahko-config.js`](https://github.com/jisotalo/shelly-porssisahko-en/blob/master/dist/shelly-porssisahko-config.js) in parallel to the main script (keep main script running).
2. Remove comments (`//`) from the settings you want to adjust. All others are kept as-is.
3. Click **save** and start the script. It will stop automatically.

Example: Adjusting number of cheapest hours to `8h`.

## FAQ

### Is support available?

No. Use at your own risk.

### Why the old script stopped working on 30.09.2025

Old versions stopped working due to new 15-minute interval spot prices.

Version 3.3.0 onwards support the new prices, but the hourly prices are calculated as average of quarter-hour prices.

### Why the script isn't working with 15 minute interval?

At the moment I don't thave time to focus on that.

### Can I set the script to use cheapest hours between 22:00-06:00?

No - the script works inside one day (24h). So 00:00-06:00 works, not 22:00-06:00.

One solution is to select 22:00-00:00 and 00:00-06:00 - in the long run it might work OK.

### Why the script isn't getting prices?

Sometimes Elering might have API issues. It's important to set backup hours for situations like this.

Check first discussion in Finnish at [https://github.com/jisotalo/shelly-porssisahko/issues/59](https://github.com/jisotalo/shelly-porssisahko/issues/59) and send a new comment there if needed.

Check Diagnostics log in Shelly for errors. 
You can open the Elering URL in web browser and see if the CSV file has valid data for 24 hours. If not, the script can't get the data either.

![alt text](img/error-getting-prices.png)

The address is similar to: [https://dashboard.elering.ee/api/nps/price/csv?fields=fi&start=2024-12-05T00:00:00%2b02:00&end=2024-12-05T23:59:59%2b02:00](https://dashboard.elering.ee/api/nps/price/csv?fields=fi&start=2024-12-05T00:00:00%2b02:00&end=2024-12-05T23:59:59%2b02:00)

You can also check if Elering is offering valid price data: [https://dashboard.elering.ee/et/nps/price](https://dashboard.elering.ee/et/nps/price). If not, the script can't get the data either.


### How reliable is this script?

The target is to create a script that can be installed once and then forgotten.

Personally, the v.2 has been running nicely for over 100 days straight.

![alt text](img/uptime.png)

### Why I sometimes get HTTP error 503?

The script will answer with 503 when it's doing something (to save memory).

Try again.

### Why the device name says "not set"?

You haven't set a custom name for device. It can be set from Shelly Web UI: `Settings` -> `Device name`.

### How to use with Switch Add-On?

Tested with Shelly Pro3EM + Switch Add-on.

You will see the output number in Shelly control panel. In this example, it's `100`.

![image](https://github.com/jisotalo/shelly-porssisahko/assets/13457157/81babe94-1999-4890-ab80-c2f9ffbd54e0)

Use that value as `Shelly outputs` setting in this script.

### When the script reads the prices for tomorrow?

At 15:00 - Elering offers the new prices at around 14:30.

### Where are the settings saved to?

Shelly KVS memory (Advanced -> KVS). They are as JSON and can be freely edited manually.

Script needs to be restarted for the changes to take effect. 

![alt text](img/kvs.png)

### Why is the history length so short?

24 last control changes are saved to history to save memory.

- One control in use -> 24 last changes
- Two controls in use -> 12 last changes each
- Three controls in use -> 8 last changes each

## Technical info

### General

* Shelly is low on memory so many things are done in an ugly manner
* Some variables are at global scope because Shelly js engine stack issues
* The final script is done by "building" (minimizing, base64 encoding, gzipping)
* Use [Eleringin CSV API](https://dashboard.elering.ee/assets/api-doc.html#/nps-controller/getPriceAsCSVUsingGET) to save memory (instead of JSON)
* v. 3.4.0 uses around 18kb of Shelly memory (plenty of space left for other scripts)

```
script:1: {
  id: 1,
  running: true,
  mem_used: 11886,
  mem_peak: 21434,
  mem_free: 13300,
  cpu: 2
},
```

### Building the script

1) Install Node.js 
2) Clone repository and open terminal in `shelly-porssisahko` folder
3) Run `npm i`
4) Run `npm run build`
5) Scripts are generated to `dist/`
